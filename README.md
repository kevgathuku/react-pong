### [React-Pong](https://react-pong.vercel.app/)

This is a simple single-player Pong game built in React + Pixi.js

### To Play:

To move the left paddle, use keys `A` and `Z` to move the paddle up and down respectively

To move the right paddle, use the ⬆️ and ⬇️ arrow buttons

NB:
This only supports playing from one browser at a time.
i.e. for 2 players to play the same game, they would have to be on the same computer playing synchronously

Multi-user functionality coming soon sometime in the future 😅 😅
